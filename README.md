# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains notebooks and practice files focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to analyze datasets, visualize patterns, and prepare data for further modeling.

---

## **Overview**
- Understand datasets by performing summary statistics and visualization.  
- Use Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis.  
- Identify relationships, patterns, and anomalies.  
- Prepare data for **preprocessing and feature engineering** steps.

---

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. Pandas**
- DataFrame and Series basics  
- Reading and writing data (CSV, Excel, etc.)  
- Handling missing values  
- GroupBy, merge, and join operations  
- Data cleaning and transformation  

### **2. NumPy**
- Array creation and indexing  
- Mathematical operations on arrays  
- Broadcasting and reshaping  
- Useful NumPy functions for statistics  

### **3. Matplotlib**
- Basic plotting (line, bar, scatter, histogram, pie)  
- Customizing plots (labels, titles, legends, colors)  
- Subplots and figure size adjustments  
- Data visualization for EDA insights  

### **4. EDA Process**
- Univariate analysis (distribution, frequency counts)  
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis  
- Correlation and heatmaps  
- Outlier detection  
- Ranking and summary visualizations
